		<h2>New Era with the New UT</h2>

		<p class="quote">Jammu and Kashmir is a region administered by India as a union territory, and constituting the southern portion of the larger Kashmir region, which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947, and between India and China since 1962.The region of Jammu and Kashmir is separated by the Line of Control from the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north respectively. It lies to the north of the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and to the west of Ladakh, which is also subject to the dispute as a part of Kashmir, and administered by India as a union territory.</p>

		<p>The order comes two days after the nation's newest union territories were formally created and received their first Lieutenant Governors; Girish Chandra Murmu, the former Union Expenditure Secretary, was sworn in as the first Lieutenant-Governor of Jammu and Kashmir</p>

		<p>The new UTs came into existence on Thursday, which was the 144th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who is credited for the merger of over 560 princely states into the Union of India.With the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir, the number of states in India has come down to 28 and the number of Union Territories has gone up to nine.</p>

		<h2>The Capital in a Gas Chamber</h2>

		<p class="quote">
			Amid a blame game over failure to check toxic haze that has enveloped the national capital and neighbouring areas, the governments of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana on Saturday called for urgent intervention by the Centre to develop and implement a joint plan with the states to address the "serious" situation.
		</p>

		<p>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday said that national capital may receive rainfall after November 6 due to the increase in the wind speed in the region, bringing some relief from the hazardous air quality.</p>

		<p>The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution reduced from 44 per cent on Friday, the season's highest, to 17 per cent on Saturday, according to government air quality monitor SAFAR. But the city's air quality is likely to remain "severe" due to calm winds, which is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants, it said.</p>
